PGScout is a webservice that takes coordinates and encounter ID of a Pokémon in Pokémon GO and returns their stats like individual values, CP and level.

**Bonus feature #1**: PGScout also **pulls the moveset rating A to F from [GamePress](https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg)**. So you will instantly know whether your Pokémon has an optimal moveset for attack and/or defense. See [Vaporeon on GamePress](https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/pokemon/134#movesets) for an example of moveset ratings.

**Bonus feature #2**: PGScout also works if you don't have the `encounter_id` and `spawn_point_id` of the Pokémon which are usually necessary to perform the encounter request. **Location and Pokédex ID is enough** for PGScout to work. It will scan the area for the desired Pokémon and perform the encounter afterwards.

# Disclaimer
PGScout or its author takes no responsibility if your accounts get banned in any way. As with any other 3rd party software breaking the ToS there is absolutely no guarantee that your accounts stay safe. This software is purely for educational purpose.

# Requirements
PGScout cannot work on itself. You need the following things:
* One or more Pokémon GO accounts (level 30+ needed). See [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongodev/comments/66m89y/interesting_news_iv_and_moveset_differ_depending/) here. **As of 2017-04-28 everything below level 30 seems to be scrambled and totally random for everyone.** :-/
* A [Bossland PokeHash Key](https://talk.pogodev.org/d/51-api-hashing-service-by-pokefarmer)

# How it works
An incoming web-request to PGScout will create a job that is being put in a queue. All configured accounts will attach to this queue, pull jobs, perform the corresponding encounters and attach the found information back to the job, marking the job as completed. The incoming web-request waits for the job to be completed and returns the result JSON encoded to the requesting client.

# Configuration
Just copy `config.ini.sample` to `config.ini` and change what you want/need to change.
Configuration parameters can also be given on the commandline:

```
-h, --help            show this help message and exit

```

Defaults are:

* `host`: 127.0.0.1 - Set this to `0.0.0.0` to open up PGScout to the public.
* `port`: 4242
* `level`: 30
* `shadowban-threshold`: 5

Don't forget to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` at least once before actually starting PGScout with `python pgscout.py`.

# Requests
PGScout accepts **HTTP GET** requests at `http://<your host>:<port>/iv` and needs these parameters:

* `pokemon_id`: The Pokédex number of the Pokémon
* `encounter_id`: Encounter ID (Base64 encoded **or** as long integer) provided by map scanner
* `spawn_point_id`: ID of spawn point provided by map scanner as **hex string**
* `latitude`
* `longitude`

An example **request** looks like this:
```
http://localhost:4242/iv?pokemon_id=70&encounter_id=MTY4MjU4OTY4Njg2MjExOTUwNA%3D%3D&spawn_point_id=47bf32c2c4d&latitude=51.124696678951&longitude=6.89885987319504
```

The **response** is JSON formatted and looks like this:
```javascript
{
    "success": true,
    "encounter_id": 16389112216478965452,
    "encounter_id_b64": "MTYzODkxMTIyMTY0Nzg5NjU0NTI=",
    "encountered_time": 1493990168.06719,
    "iv_percent": 55.55555555555556,
    "iv_attack": 3,
    "iv_defense": 13,
    "iv_stamina": 9,
    "move_1": 230,
    "move_2": 107,
    "cp": 282,
    "cp_multiplier": 0.29024988412857056,
    "level": 5,
    "catch_prob_1": 0.0861327052116394,
    "catch_prob_2": 0.1263757348060608,
    "catch_prob_3": 0.1648465394973755,
    "gender": 1,
    "height": 1.6896531581878662,
    "weight": 108.0298080444336,
    "rating_attack": "A",
    "rating_defense": "B",
    "scout_level": 30
}
```

Most fields of the response should be self-explanatory.
* `encountered_time`: The timestamp when the scout account made the encounter.
* `rating_attack` and `rating_defense`: The moveset rating according to [GamePress](https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg) for attack and defense. If the moveset has no rating the field will contain a dash: "-"
* `cp_multiplier` "CP Multiplier (CPM) is a number which Niantic uses to scale the attributes of a pokemon based on its level." PGScout uses this number to determine the Pokémon level. Read more at [GamePress](https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/cp-multiplier).
* `level`: The Pokémon level which is being represented by the arc in the Pokémon details in the game. Wild Pokémon will have a level that is limited by the trainer level but not larger than 30, so a trainer with level 17 may find Pokémon from level 1 to 17 but a level 34 trainer may only find Pokémon from level 1 to 30. So 30 is the absolute maximum for wild Pokémon. *(Note that Pokémon being hatched from eggs have an upper limit of level 20.)*
* `catch_prob_1` to `catch_prob_3`: These are the catch probabilities for a regular Pokéball (1), a Great Ball (2) and an Ultra Ball (3). The higher the number the higher the chance to catch the Pokémon with the corresponding ball for a regular hit. Maximum is 1.0 which corresponds to 100% catch probability, so you **will** catch the Pokémon however you hit it.
* `scout_level`: The trainer level of the scout account being used.

## Unown Form

If a scout encounters a **Unown** its **form** will be returned under key `form` in the response.

# Reliability
PGScout detects your scout account trainer level and therefore knows which values are reliable and sets the others to `null`. Reliable means that the value is the same for all other trainers of the same or higher level.

**Update from 2017-04-28**: Every stats (IV, height, weight, moves, CP, etc.) now seems to be totally unique for every player below level 30 even if their trainer level is the same. So using scout accounts below level 30 does not make sense at all.

# Errors
If PGScout encounters an error, the response will look something like this:
```javascript
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Pokemon already despawned."
}
```
